# dfir
 **dfir** if acronym for download file(s) in Rust

Idea is to have code examples of how to download files in Rust using different techniques, and benchmark them.

Techniques:
- blocking [reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest)
    - in sequence new client for each file -> done
    - in sequence same client for each file -> done
    - new thread for each file -> done
    - threadpool for all files -> done
    - threadpool for all files, but with reuse of client -> TODO
- async/await -> TODO

## Test data
Is in testdata directory, it is random data generated by  with following Bash shell script code:

```bash
for i in {001..100}; do head -c 10240 </dev/urandom > file_"$i".bin; done
```
This code will generate 100 files, each with 10KB or random data.
